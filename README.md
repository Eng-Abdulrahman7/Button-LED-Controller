# Button-LED-Controller
This Arduino project uses three push buttons (pins 2-4) to independently control three LEDs (pins 11-13). When a button is pressed (HIGH state), its corresponding LED turns on, and turns off when released. The setup initializes the pins, while the loop continuously checks button states and updates the LEDs accordingly.
